# DeliveryPriorityEstimator

**DeliveryPriorityEstimator** is a machine learning model developed to classify deliveries into urgency levels: **Low**, **Medium**, or **High**. It is intended to help decision-making in food delivery systems.

## ðŸš€ Purpose

This model is designed to enhance logistical efficiency by automatically assessing the urgency of each delivery request based on multiple relevant features.

## ðŸ§  Model Overview

It outputs one of the three urgency levels:

- **0**: Low
- **1**: Medium
- **2**: High

## ðŸ”Œ Integration
The model was integrated into a "SustainaFood" website built using the MERN stack and Flask (web platform designed to reduce food waste). The model serves as a backend ML service that receives feature vectors and returns the predicted urgency level.
